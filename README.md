# Undefined Meet

Simple self-hosted meeting app that uses Jitsi for video conferencing, plus a minimal React frontend and a small Node.js backend for auth/JWT and light API work.

## Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Node.js (Express) â€” issues JWTs, handles GitHub OAuth and users API
- Video: [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/)
- Web server / TLS: Nginx on the host (recommended) or a containerized reverse proxy
- Orchestration: docker-compose for Backend and Jitsi services
